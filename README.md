# Windmesser

I need to retract the awning above our terrasse if the wind is too strong.
For that I first need to find out, how strong the wind is.
Then I need to make the wind speed available to my home automation.

Therefore, I need an anemometer from which I can read the windspeed with an ESP8266.
